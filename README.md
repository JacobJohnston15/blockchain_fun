Gambling in Bitcoin
==========================================================

The purpose of this project is to detmerine the percentage of gambling transactions that occur in the blockchain of
Bitcoin. 

bitcoin.py serves as a program that pulls blocks and individual transactions from the blockchain 
(https://blockchain.info/). The program then compares the outputs of each transaction to gambling wallet addresses. 

The gambling wallet addresses that the transactions are compared to can be found in the constants.py file. 

This list of gambling addresses is one of the most comprehensive gambling wallet address lists to date and will be
added to as more ganbling wallet addresses are discovered. 

For more information on the program or for questions and collaboration requests please contact
